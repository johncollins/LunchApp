                <h2>About LunchApp</h2>
                <p>LunchApp is a website you can use at your workplace (or other group setting) in order to ensure the group is well acquainted. This was envisioned while working at a medium sized company which was in the process of decline and division as a way to lift spirits, see what other people were up to and generally meet your coworkers. 
                <p>How it works is this. If you haven't gone out to lunch with an individual you're more likely to be put in a group with them. Parties are 3 or 4 by default when the number of pariticipants is greater than 5 and 2 or 3 otherwise. One participant per group is made the organizer to avoid the kind of apathy caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility">diffusion of responsibility</a>. Finally, lunch happens once a month. People have between the first and fifteenth to sign up and the rest of the month to go for lunch.
                <p>Participants are notified by email when groups are made.
